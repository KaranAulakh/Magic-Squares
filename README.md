# Magic-Squares
This application is used to find many different compositions of magic squares for different sizes of magic squares. To elaborate, a magic square is a unique grid of numbers that contains every sequential unique number organized such that every row, column and diagonal add up to the same sum
The application can be run using pa1.cpp and pa1.h as of now. I am also currently working on another way to solve the magic square problem using permutations such that all possible magic squares can be found as opposed to just 12
